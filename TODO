TODO:
1. Implement Consensus
    - Nodes maintain same consistent values (already done)
    - When offline noes come back online, their values should
        be consistent with the majority of nodes

2. Idea:
    - When sending a heartbeat, the leader sends his most recent cache


- Leader goes down, new leader is elected
- New leader sends heartbeat, marks the old leader as dead
- Value is updated and all alive nodes reach consensus

- Node comes back online as a follower, consensus is broken
- New leader sees that the dead node is now alive, and sends follow-up message:
    type: APPEND_ENTRIES
    data: HashMap cache


- Follower goes down, leader sends heartbeat and marks the downed node as dead
- Value is updated and all alive nodes reach consensus
- Nodes comes back online and consensus is broken
- Leader sees that the dead node is now alive and sends follow-up message
