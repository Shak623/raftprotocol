Steps

1. Implement leader election.
  a. RaftNode becomes candidate
  b. RaftNode sends vote requests to each peer.
  c. When new leader is recognized, randomize the election timeout.

2. When fresh node starts, it will hit election timeout and begin leader election. Since other nodes
already have a leader, once they receive REQUEST_VOTE Message they should respond with the correct leader.

Added:
  1. if votes are tied and no more peers can vote, begin new election cycle from the start

  2. HEARTBEAT messages don't exist, they are merely APPEND_ENTRIES messages with no content
      Implement VOTE_REQUEST message handling in PassiveMessageThread
  3. Implement APPEND_ENTRIES instead of heartbeat, and when a node receives this from a node that
  is not its leader, then set leader to the node

  4. at the start of a new election term, randomize the election timeout

  5. Implement Heartbeat
    a. Add last updated attribute
    b. When receiving message from a leader or candidate, refresh our last updated to current time.
