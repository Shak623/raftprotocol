1. Fix socket timeout error when trying to connect to a dead leader

2. Fix dockerfile name.



Added:
  - await response in RaftNode.sendMessage()
  - send response in PassiveMessageThread
  - moved MessageType processing logic to RaftNode.processMessage()
  - randomNumberGenerator(max, min) --> randomizeElectionTimeout()
  - Added log() for uniform output
  - deleted Peer.type and Peer.lastUpdated attribute

  - Changed new term mechanism:
    - new term when leader election starts
    - new term when request vote is received
    - hasVoted false when new leader elected



  if peer is on next term, vote yes
  if peer is on same term, vote yes iff !hasVoted
