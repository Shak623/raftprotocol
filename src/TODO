Log Replication:

    - In client passive message thread, add processing of APPEND_ENTRIES_RESPONSE to print the value.

Done:
    1. Create Client Class
        a. Create Broadcast thread (Track nodes)
        b. Discover leader dynamically
        c. Main method includes command line input (Add/Update, Retrieve, Delete)
        d. Client attempts connection with leader to send the change.
            If failed, assume leader is dead, remove address from list, try next address to find new leader.

    2. Docker
        a. Connect separate client container to existing docker network
        b. Create dockerfile for client node

    3. Add File I/O to Node.RaftNode
        a. Append to files
        b. Read from files
        c. Delete entry in file

    4. Process append entry messages/ append entry response

    5. Create misc.LogEntry class for sending message from client to leader
        a. Class has key-value pair
        b. Enum for log operation (Retrieve, Update, Delete -- RUD)

    - On startup, check for existence of cache file. If exists, load cache from file.
